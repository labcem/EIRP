# EIRP
Equivalent isotropic radiated power automation scripts in Python.

Calibration and measurement with R&S signal generator, R&S spectrum analyser and a Frankonia anechoic chamber controlled with a FC-06 (Antenna mast and turntable).


Needed:
- Python 2.7
- Numpy
- PyVisa
- Matplotlib

`Calibration.py` performs the calibration of the chamber and take a single value for the cables' losses, sufficient for narrow bandwidth testings.

In order to improve the accuracy of the calibration and of the measurement cable losses should be measured for every tested frequency or at least derived from a recent measurement.

`Cable_Losses.py` performs the measurement of the losses of the emittting antenna cables for the calibration.

`Calibration_without_Cable_losses_measurement.py` performs the calibration of the chamber and uses a txt file to take the losses into account.

`Calibration_with_Cable_losses_measurement.py` performs the measurement of the cable losses and the calibration of the chamber.

`EIRP.py` performs the measurement (3 cutting planes), and renders the radiation pattern.

`EIRP_light.py` allows to choose the cutting plane and the polarisation by completing a (polarisation x cutting planes) matrix.

`SignalGenerator.py`, `Spectrum.py`, `FC06.py` are instrument classes containing the basic functions to control the instruments.
